- [niri: Making a Wayland compositor in Rust](https://youtu.be/Kmz8ODolnDg?list=PLRdS-n5seLRqrmWDQY4KDqtRMfIwU0U3T) \
My talk from the 2024 Moscow RustCon about niri, and how I do randomized property testing and profiling, and measure input latency.
The talk is in Russian, but I prepared full English subtitles that you can find in YouTube's subtitle language selector.
